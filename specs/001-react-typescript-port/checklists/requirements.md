# Specification Quality Checklist: Rebuild linhe.me as a typed single-page site

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The feature is a technology migration, so the chosen stack is unavoidable context. It is kept to
  one Assumptions line that points to the constitution; requirements and success criteria describe
  behaviour only. FR-012/FR-014/FR-015 name files and "type errors" because they come straight
  from the owner's request and are checked by listing files, not by inspecting code.
- Validation passed on the first iteration.
